# C# Questions 1
1. What is a namespace? Name-space is used in C# to organize all of its classes.
2. What are value types? Value types hold some kind of data in C# and can stores different kind of data.
3. What are reference types? Reference types work a little like value types, but are used with string and classes and not so much data.
4. What is an automatic property and how is it useful? Automatic property allows classes to become public.
5. What is the purpose of using statement? Using is used to dispose of some object.
6. What are dynamic type variables? This tells the compiler that variables are able to change.
7. What is the purpose of the is operator? It is used to check the run time of on object.
8. What are generics and how is using them useful? Allows you to work with any data type in your class or method.
9. What is the scope of a public member of a class? A public member can be accessed from an outside class.
10. Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments? Yes by using a method parameter.
11. How do you sort an array? You have to sort the array in ascending order then reverse it.
12. What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve? You can store any value with null and it allows you to assign a true, false or null statement.
13. What is an enumeration? Enums contain its own 2 values can cannot go through inheritance.
14. What is inheritance? It allows you to pass down attributes and behaviors from existing classes.
15. Is multiple inheritance supported? No you can only inherit from one parent class.
16. What is the purpose of as operator. It allows you to cast a object to a type or class.
17. What is an object? An object is the parent of inheritance of types.
18. What is the difference between a struct and a class? Structs are are value types whereas Classes are reference types.
19. What is the difference between continue and break statements? Continue will not break the loop whereas break will stop and break the loop.
20. What is this and how is it used? It is used to see the current instance of a class.
21. What is try and catch and when are they used? It is used to catch exceptions so the application does not crash.
22. How is exception handling done? It goes through try, catch, finally and throw.
23. What is finally and what is its purpose? It releases the systems resources when try and catch leaves the execution.
24. List the differences between Array and ArrayList. Array is a fixed length data structure while an ArrayList is a variable length Collection Class.
25. What is an object? An object is the parent of inheritance of types.
26. Define constructor. When a class is created a constructor automatically initializes values to its data members.
27. When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined? It can be used when it is used to indirectly declare a variable and it is defined by the compiler during the generation.
28. What is an abstract class? A class that contains one or more abstract methods.
29. What is an interface? It contains the methods properties and events, but not the implementation.
30. What is a method? A method is a code block that contains a series of statements that are to be executed.
31. What is a property? They are class members that allows us to access and modify methods.
32. What is an access specifier? This is an accessibility level of objects and its members.
33. What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean? Public, private, protected, internal and protected internal. They provide a type of security to our applications.
34. What is a collection? This allows you to access a list of items of an index.
35. What is a Hash Table? This is used when you need to access something by using a key and you identify a useful key value.
